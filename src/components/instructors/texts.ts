She is renowned for her work in women's self-defense and holds the distinction of being one of the first women to earn a black belt in 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu under Eddie Bravo.\n\nA native of California, Dawna found her way into the world of combat sports while pursuing acting and working as a massage therapist in the early 2000s. In a truly Hollywood fashion, she crossed paths with The Simpsons creator Sam Simon, who discovered her passion for boxing and took her to the legendary Wildcard Boxing gym. Sam gifted her a pair of wraps, gloves, and a year-long membership that he had won through a bet with one of the trainers. Dawna was instantly captivated. Her fascination with fighting led her to Legends MMA in 2007, where she trained in Muay Thai and MMA alongside professional fighters. It was there that she met Eddie Bravo and discovered jiu-jitsu, igniting a lifelong passion.\n\nIn 2016, Dawna began teaching women's self-defense classes and co-founded 10th Planet Women's Self Defense.

		summary:
			"Born in Wyoming but raised in Florida, Rachel found Jiu Jitsu at age 15 and immediately knew that it was going to be a lifelong endeavor. Whether it's a flaw or an attribute, she only does things with an all-in mindset, so she began training full time while in high school and continued through college. While competing all over the country, Rachel graduated college with a degree in biology. Initially she planned on continuing on in academia to get her PhD in microbiology but then decided to pursue jiu jitsu full time instead. Her science background has greatly informed her approach to the study of jiu jitsu through the years. In 2021 Rachel moved to California and began training at Atos HQ where she later received her black belt under Andre Galvao in 2022. In the summer of 2021, while PJ was preparing for ADCC, Rachel met PJ Barch at Electrum Performance strength & conditioning gym. The two quickly became friends and began training together. Realizing how valuable the opportunity was, Rachel dedicated herself to learning from PJ and quickly became a part of the team. After dedicating almost all of the first 11 years of her training to the gi, since beginning training at 10P South Bay her no gi has rapidly evolved and is now her main area of focus.",
